This percentage is higher among families of color, low-income families, and parents with less formal education.

This trend may point to a stressor on families that force primary caregivers, a majority of whom are women, to leave the workforce. This stress becomes a full-blown shock during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, where women disproportionately left or lost paid employment.

One way to understand how historically discriminatory policies translate into current inequality is to consider disparities in household wealth. While median income provides an annual view of earnings, household wealth may be more useful in understanding how past discrimination continues to impact individuals by denying them the benefit of compound economic growth.

The Working Group&rsquo;s report, including a print volume and <a href=""http://civicmemory.la/map/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">website</a>, was released in April 2021, with <a href=""https://civicmemory.la/key-recommendations/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">18 key recommendations</a> complemented by subcommittee reports, essays and photo essays, and interviews and roundtable discussions on significant topics. At the local level, historic events are often memorialized at specific street corners in a community. Various notable locations and moments in L.A.&rsquo;s&rsquo; history are mentioned throughout the report, with a select few included below. <br> <a style=""color: var(--sdg11-primary); border-bottom: 1px solid var(--sdg11-primary);"" class=""html-a""  href=""http://civicmemory.la/map/"" target=""_blank"">Learn more ></a></p>",Some notable locations mentioned in the Civic Memory report,TBA,See all the mapped locations on the civicmemory.la website.,,Past Due: Report and Recommendations of the Los Angeles Mayor’s Office Civic Memory Working Group ,http://civicmemory.la/map/,RESILIENT PUBLIC SPACES BECOME COMMUNITY SERVICE HUBS,"The <a href=""https://www.laparks.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks</a> stewards over 16,000 acres of parkland, offering extensive recreational, social and cultural programs at 444 park sites in every L.A. neighborhood from the valley to the sea.
