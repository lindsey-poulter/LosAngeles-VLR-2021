        and the
        <a href="https://mayorsfundla.org" target="_blank">Mayorâ€™s Fund for Los Angeles</a>, L.A.
        became one of the first cities in the world to take action on the SDGs at the local level in
        2017. We published our first

          >Voluntary Local Review</a

        <a href="https://sdgdata.lamayor.org" target="_blank">SDG Data Reporting Platform</a> in
        2019, and in 2020 launched our

          >SDG Activities Index</a
        >, an online encyclopedia of community-wide SDG projects and initiatives. These efforts are
        rooted in strong multi-stakeholder partnerships, including internal coordination between
        City departments and partnerships with
        <a href="https://sdg.lamayor.org/about/partners" target="_blank"
          >five academic institutions</a

        In L.A., we organize our SDG actions in three ways: we <strong>measure</strong> progress
        through data reporting; we <strong>mobilize</strong> new projects and build capacity for the
        Goals; and we <strong>connect</strong> with partners, while centering our commitment to
        <strong>leave no one behind</strong>. The SDGs in Los Angeles provide a framework that City
        departments, community-based organizations, private corporations, philanthropic leaders, and
        academic partners are using to link their work to a broader agenda, measure and report on
        their progress, and connect into an ecosystem of partners citywide.
